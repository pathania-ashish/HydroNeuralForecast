> 🔬 This repository adapts Nixtla's NeuralForecast library for hydrological research. Key modifications include **multivariable support for models that originally lacked it** in the upstream repository, along with custom run scripts for exogenous variable handling.

---

## 🔧 What's Modified

### ⚙️ Enhanced Model Architectures

Several model architectures have been modified to add **multivariable forecasting capabilities** that were **not available in the original NeuralForecast repository**. This enables models to ingest multiple input variables (e.g., precipitation, temperature etc.) simultaneously for improved hydrological prediction. For example, models such as **Informer** and **PatchTST** have been enhanced with multivariable support for hydrological inputs, among other modifications across the codebase.

### 📜 Custom Model Run Scripts

Ready-to-use scripts for running models with exogenous and multivariate configurations:

| Script | Model | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 📄 `informer_aa_exog.py` | Informer | With exogenous variables |
| 📄 `LSTM_aa_exog.py` | LSTM | With exogenous variables |
| 📄 `PatchTST_aa_exog.py` | PatchTST | With exogenous variables |
| 📄 `KAN_multi_exag.py` | KAN | Multivariate with exogenous |
| 📄 `nhits_aa_multi.py` | NHITS | Multivariate |
| 📄 `tft_aa_exog.py` | TFT | With exogenous variables |

## 🚀 Setup & Installation

### 🐳 Option 1: Docker (Recommended)

Build and run the Docker container which replicates the `neuralforecast_3.10` conda environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pathania-ashish/HydroNeuralForecast.git
cd HydroNeuralForecast

# Build the image
docker build -t hydroneuralforecast .

# Run interactively (with GPU support)
docker run --gpus all -it hydroneuralforecast bash
```

### 🐍 Option 2: Conda + pip

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pathania-ashish/HydroNeuralForecast.git
cd HydroNeuralForecast

# Create conda env with Python 3.10 and PyTorch (CUDA 12.4)
conda create -n neuralforecast_3.10 python=3.10 -y
conda activate neuralforecast_3.10
conda install pytorch=2.5.1 pytorch-cuda=12.4 -c pytorch -c nvidia

# Install pip dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install this package in editable mode
pip install -e .
```
